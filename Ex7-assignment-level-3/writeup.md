## What have I learnt?
This is revision for me so nothing new to learn, but the project work was a lot and I liked working on it and getting tired by the end of the day. I had a couple of issues and working them out with friends was really fun. For example, I had put up the date as a paragraph tag in one of the assignments, and Tinkal pointed out that the `<time></time>` tag was the correct semantic way to represent a date.
